1) Python is a popular, interpreted, dynamically-typed, high-level and general purpose programming language
   created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.

2) It has efficient high-level data structures and its elegant syntax and dynamic typing make it an ideal scripting language
   which can be used on multiple platforms (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi etc.).

3) Python is most popular in the fields of:
   Data Science and Machine Learning
   Server-side Web Development
   Software Development
   Big Data
   Mathematics and Statistics

4) The number of lines in Python programming is comparatively less compared to some other popular programming languages.

5) Python runs on an Interpreter system, meaning that the code can be executed as soon as it is written without actually
   compiling. Hence, it is very useful for quick protoyping.

6) Python can run in a procedural way, an object-oriented way and in a functional way.
