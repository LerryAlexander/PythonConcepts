# Pass

# The "pass" statement does nothing and it can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action
# They can be used inside the loops (for, while), class, functions, conditional statements and everywhere

for number in range(20):
    # It is not doing anything here but the for loop is still valid
    pass
print("**********************************************************")
